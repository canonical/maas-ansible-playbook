[x] When running the playbook for a host with the maas_region_controller role,
    the playbook installs the MAAS Region Controller

[x] A documented Ansible Variable provides the user with the ability to set
    whether it’s a deb installation or a snap installation, and additional
    variables for MAAS version, snap channel and ppa
    [x] The default installation is a snap

[x] A successful run of the playbook should give the operator an accessible
    and ready MAAS instance

[x] The installed region controller is used to set a maas_url variable when
    there is not one already set for later Rack Controller configuration use.

[~] The operator can optionally enable TLS

[x] The playbook sets up the admin user

[ ] The playbook adds any provided preseeds

[ ] Uses an Ansible Variable to determine what version of MAAS to deploy with,
    won’t execute (i.e “skipped” in the context of Ansible) if host_vars show
    the Ubuntu version is incompatible with the version and install method

[ ] The Region Controller tasks should be able to execute on multiple hosts in
    a single execution if the target is an Ansible Group rather than a single host

[x] Only install the maas-region-api deb if using the deb installation

[x] Once the region controller is installed, run migrations using the configured
    postgresql primary instance

[ ] Running on an already configured machine but with a new version should
    upgrade the instance

[ ] The operator should be able to override the postgres DSN variable and not
    set the maas_postgresql_primary or maas_postgresql_secondary on any machine
    to be able to use an existing Postgresql instance not managed by this playbook

[ ] Optionally install grafana agent
